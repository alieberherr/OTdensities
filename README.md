# OTdensities

Codes and data files to accompany the report "Optimal Transport distances to characterise electronic excitations".

# Code

| name | description |
|------|-------------|
| lambda.py | calculates $\Lambda$ diagnostic | 
| lambda_sq.py | calculates modified $\Lambda$ (same as $S$ in eq. [...] from [2] |
| theta.py | calculates $\Theta$ diagnostic |
| utils.py | general functions such as reading a .cub file into an array |

# Data

1. Input files: Input files for the TDDFT calculations with Turbomole and Orca
2. Excitation energies: Values of TDDFT excitation energies from Turbomole, Orca and article [1]
3. $\Lambda$ (absolute value of orbitals as well as absolute value squared) and $\Theta$ values
